## Topic
Real / Fake Job Posting Prediction 

## Reason why we chose this topic
During topic selection, we preferred topic that is interesting and has a challenging dataset. 
Seeking job posting is really common for most of the people, and  there have been many job postings that are fraudlent. Thus, we thought it would be interesting to analyze the dataset to predict fake job posting. 

Information security and privacy has been a major focus when it comes to online security. The ability to falsify information such as a company along with a job listing will negatively impact an unsuspecting individual in giving their information away. Job hunting is both widespread and consistent amongst a wide array of groups thus making the dataset larger in volume for machine learning models.

## Description of the source of data
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle, and this dataset has 17838 rows by 18 columns. 
Dataset will be used to creat classification models to predict the fake job posting.  

## Quesitons we hope to answer
Is neural networking able to accurately predict the legitimacy of job postings based on posting information such as description, salary, pay and other metrics commonly seen on a wide array of job boards.

## Communication Protocol
Slack will be major communication platform for this project.
